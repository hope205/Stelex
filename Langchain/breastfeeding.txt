Ever noticed that when your baby is teething their crankiness and discomfort seems to get worse at night? Or even how sometimes they seem TOTALLY fine during the day and then suddenly at night they can’t seem to settle and are fussy and cranky and you’re not even sure why only later to notice they have puffy red gums or even a brand new tooth?

It’s not your imagination, this really does happen and there’s a reasonable explanation too. Which means there’s also something you can do about it.

What’s the deal? Why are teething symptoms worse at night?

Teething babies are often at the age of exploration of the world around them. They are ready to move! Even if they aren’t very mobile, they’re rapidly taking in information, interacting socially, and physically developing new skills daily. A little bit of teething isn’t going to slow them down, they’ve got people to see, places to go, adventures to take, play to make! Even if they do have moments during the day, there’s a lot going on around them to distract them at least a little bit from what’s going on in their mouth and head.

Once regular night time and day time sleep patterns are worked out in the brain, right around 4 months, babies have the same general physiological cycles related to sleep in their bodies as adults do. During the day the build something that’s called sleep pressure in the brain which makes them ready to sleep at night (give or take… and that doesn’t mean they won’t fight sleep, just that their brain is ready for it biologically), their bodies naturally release melatonin as daylight fades and artificial light lowers, and their cortisol levels naturally drop to make it easier for them to sleep at night. Just like adults, as they get tired and ready for sleep, they can become more emotional and little challenges will suddenly seem bigger.

What does this have to do with worsening teething symptoms? Lower cortisol levels means that stressors like pain aren’t being managed as much by the brain and become more noticeable. Not only are there less distractions to take their attention off the discomfort, there is even less of the chemical cocktail the body produces that helps with coping with such discomfort.

Meaning more ouch.

That’s not all, either.

The body does most of the growing it needs to do during sleep. Sometimes our children literally do wake up bigger in the morning, their bodies having been busy during the night before. While asleep, the body can efficiently direct energy to growth and healing. Exactly why doctors have been telling us to sleep when sick, rest is essential for growth and repair. This includes teeth! It is very possible your baby’s teething symptoms get worse at night because their teeth really are moving more at night. A process that involves shifting bone and slowly cutting through gum tissue causing headaches, mouth pain, and general discomfort. No wonder there are tears!

With nothing to distract them, lower levels of chemicals that reduce pain, and more movement of the teeth at night all combine to create a perfect storm of middle of the night fussiness or downright screaming.

What can help?

While you can’t change the natural sleep patterns in the body, you can help make your baby more comfortable through teething. Nothing is a guarantee but every little bit of hope help and any of these steps may at least help reduce discomfort so there’s a bit more rest for everyone.

 

 

Respond quickly. Don’t wait for your baby’s fussing to escalate to full-fledged wailing in distress. Being responsive to their early communication that they need help will help them emotionally regulate and manage the stress of their discomfort as calmly as they possibly can.

Rule out other concerns. Just to be sure that your baby’s distress is about teething pain, check out your baby to rule out any other concerns. This will allow you to relax as much as possible that their discomfort is unfortunate but not alarming. With your anxiety lower, your baby will pick up on your calm and feel safe and secure that you are there with them even though they’re uncomfortable.

Nurse more! Breastfeeding releases chemicals in the baby’s brain that actually lower pain levels. Nurse is already co-regulating for emotional distress, the oxytocin released in calming and connecting but studies show that a baby being latched and sucking, receiving their milk from their parent, can reduce pain and even keep it from starting. Nursing more could be the ticked to getting through those nighttime teething pains.

Skin-to-skin. Easily accomplished with nursing but possible to do otherwise too, skin-to-skin as pain relief and soothing measures for pain is an incredibly effective non-pharmacological means to help your baby feel better.

Protect naps. Sleep begets sleep and lack of sleep can show up as hyperactivity at night. Protecting sleep during the day means that nap times are even more important. You may decide that more or longer nap times are worth the possible nighttime sleep shortening if teething is going on for a while and your little one just can’t seem to get enough sleep at night.

Earlier bedtime. If sleep has already been disrupted, having an earlier bedtime may help get more quality sleep in before the pain and discomfort kicks into high gear during the night. It isn’t uncommon for babies and toddlers to have difficulty sleeping after 11pm or midnight meaning you’ll easily see 1am, 2am, and 3am when they are teething if they’re really uncomfortable. Getting to bed earlier (you too!) may mean there’s more sleep happening that is better quality before the disruptions get started.

Rocking, swinging, swaying. There’s a reason most of us automatically start swaying or rocking when we hear a baby crying even if we’re not holding the baby ourselves: rocking soothes the brain! Studies show that rocking or swinging lowers stress levels, reduces pain and discomfort, and soothes emotional dysregulation. As simple as it may seem, rocking your baby at night really does help them feel better and you too!

Pain relief mediation. Liquid infant Ibuprofen or Acetaminophen may reduce your baby’s pain enough for them to get the sleep they need… and maybe you too! Be sure to use according to directions and try not to use more than 3 nights in a row and check with your child’s healthcare provider before administering.

Teething gel. There are safe, soothing teething gel options you can put directly on your baby’s gums to help reduce inflammation and pain. Be sure it doesn’t have benzocaine or other numbing agents in them as that can create a risk of choking and impair their swallowing.

Teething tablets. With a safe blend of herbs, teething tablets dissolve easily for baby and 

Have realistic expectations. Cutting teeth IS painful. It’s a lot of work and it is understandable that your baby complains about it. They want help making the pain goaway for good reason. Having realistic expectations about teething will help you stay calm even when you’re exhausted and feeling helpless and your baby will be able to draw from your calm for their own calm.

Remember this is temporary. Teething does stop at some point. Your baby isn’t going to be cutting new teeth forever. There may be long stretches of teething (my baby once cute 12 teeth one right after the other, teething for a few months straight) which makes it really difficult to remember that this is temporary but keeping that in mind can help get through those long nights.




 How To Treat Eela In Babies

Most babies are prone to skin inflammation, this is solely because of the fragility of their body system. Baby rashes on the face, body or bum are very common. It is not something to fret over. One such skin disorder is known as Eela. 

 

The term Eela is used by the Yorubas to describe a skin infection known as Infantile Seborrheic Dermatitis(ISD) that is prominent in babies in their early stage of infancy. It usually starts about a few weeks from birth and lingers till the 6th month or more. 

 

The Igbos refer to it as nla. ISD is an inflammation in the skin found mostly in the skin folds like the neck, elbow joints, ears and buttocks and especially in chubby babies. It alters the normal smoothness and fineness of a baby’s skin.

 

It is always a worrisome experience for both the mother and baby as it makes the child uncomfortable. A child who is affected most times encounters difficulty sleeping due to irritation of the skin, you see such babies turning from side to side, itching severely, and, most of the time, developing a fever.

 
Causes

Some experts suggest this may spring out as a result of poor hygiene, but this is not entirely true as the major cause is not known. It is rather safe to say it is due to the baby’s skin sensitivity and ability to respond to allergies.

 

You know how we react to some things, and we do not even understand why, most times, this is because of the sensitivity of our body system. It also may be attached to genetics, which is why it is not a necessary stage. All babies do not get affected.

 
Treatment /preventive measures 

Is your baby experiencing this discomfort? Are the incessant cry from the irritation on their skin becoming a source of worry to you, do not be overly worked up, It heals gradually on its own over time. Here is the list of things you may want to try that help manage the symptoms and prevents a recurrence.

 

    Bathe your baby with warm water, especially in the afternoons, and afterwards, dress him in loose, cool clothing to let air permeate so as to avoid the prickly feeling. This soothes the skin and calms the irritation resulting from Eela.

That notwithstanding, we do not say you expose the baby to cold. Remember, their body is still quite susceptible.

 

    Wash hair often with mild soap or shampoo for the ones that affect the baby’s scalp. Apply baby hair oil and allow it to sit for a few hours before scrubbing gently with a soft brush.

 

    Change the baby’s diapers frequently, as prolonged use can contribute; always check for wetness. Also, allow the buttocks to breathe sometimes. It equally helps to prevent diaper rash.

 

    Do not leave your baby’s skin dry. The skin should be moisturized often, Ideally immediately after a shower. Pat your baby’s skin dry and apply a coat of petroleum jelly or other hydrocortisone-containing creams on affected areas. Lotions that do not contain too much liquid are most suitable. Coconut oil which contains antifungal and antimicrobial properties, can be used as a substitute.

 

    Most people use powder, but it does not help as this may leave the affected area dry and flaky. It’s best to leave the skin moisturized. If you must use powder, ensure it is not harsh or minty.

 

    As much as ISD may not be related to how hygienic one is, it is still beautiful if you keep good hygiene, wash with mild detergents, and keep an eye on what your baby gets into the mouth. Endeavour to keep your environment clean and free from bacteria.

 

    For home remedies, you can try cucumbers, it assists in alleviating itchiness because of its anti-inflammatory properties. You can slice and place bits on affected areas, being careful not to let them get into your baby’s eyes. It always leaves a lasting cooling effect. Aloe Vera is another of its kind, extract the gel and pat gently on the reactions.

 

Infantile Seborrheic Dermatitis is not contagious, it does not mean your baby is infected. It is not something to be panicky over as it disappears with time.

 

Do not purchase steroids without a prescription. Ensure you speak to a paediatrician before administering, as some over-the-counter medications pose more of a threat. It would also be nice if you consult before trying any home remedy.

All formula milk comes with instructions explaining how to make up the right amount for your baby. Formula milk is available for different ages of infant and you should make sure your baby is drinking the correct one for his age. Don’t add extra milk powder into your baby’s bottle as this will provide unnecessary calories and may encourage too many fat cells to be produced.

There is no précised answer to how much formula milk your baby should be having overall. When your baby is newborn, he will only take small feeds –probably around 60ml at each meal. But this will increase rapidly as he grows. The amount of milk a baby needs is generally given as around 75-80 ml for each 0.5kg of body weight. Therefore if your baby weighs 4kg, he would need about 750ml of formula milk per 24-hour period.

As a rule, bottle fed babies feed less often than breastfeeding ones. This is due to the speed with which the different pints of milk is digested, formula milk taking longer. On average, your baby will probably feed on the bottle about six times during a 24 – hour period.

Bottle Fed babies are rarely underfed, but it is important to feed on demand and not at the times you dictate. Check that the teat on the bottle is large enough for your baby’s needs. If she cries or upset – especially at the end of a feed, when the bottle is completely empty – then try offering him a little more milk.

When your baby hits six months and starts eating solids, the amount of milk he consumes will decrease, as he fills himself up with food other than milk. But if you have any concerns about your baby’s development while bottle-feeding, do talk to your midwife or health visitor.




FEEDING ADVICE

It is more likely that you will try to give your baby more milk than if you were breastfeeding. For this reason, it’s important to let him decide when he has had enough to drink so you don’t overfeed him. While it’s fine to give your baby more milk if he appears unsatisfied at the end of the feed, it is bad practice to try and make him finish every last drop if he seems satisfied with what he has already drunk.

Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions when making up a formula feed to ensure your baby is receiving the right quantities of formula and water.
Throw away the contents of any unused bottles of formula milk after 24 hours.
Throw away ready-to-feed containers of formula milk after 48 hours once they have been opened.
Throw away any formula milk left over after a feed of bacteria from your baby’s saliva may contaminate it.

 Postpartum Lochia: Everything You Need to Know as a Nigerian Mom 
 

Childbirth is an amazing experience, but it comes with many changes in a woman's body. Postpartum lochia is one of the changes that occur after childbirth, which Nigerian moms need to be aware of.

 

In this blog post, we will discuss everything you need to know about postpartum lochia, which includes its causes, symptoms, and preventive measures.

 
What is postpartum lochia?

 

Postpartum lochia is a natural vaginal discharge after a woman gives birth. This discharge contains blood, mucus, and uterine tissue that the body sheds as it heals after childbirth. It usually lasts for a few weeks, gradually becoming lighter in color and amount. However, it can vary from woman to woman, and sometimes heavy bleeding and clotting can occur.

 

During pregnancy, the lining of the uterus thickens to support the developing fetus. After childbirth, the uterus needs to shed this lining to return to its pre-pregnancy size and shape, which leads to the discharge of postpartum lochia.

 
Causes of postpartum lochia

 

Postpartum lochia is caused by the shedding of the uterine lining after childbirth. During pregnancy, the uterus undergoes significant changes to accommodate the growing fetus. The lining of the uterus thickens, the blood vessels within it enlarge, and the uterus expands in size.

 

After childbirth, the uterus must return to its pre-pregnancy state, which involves shedding the uterine lining necessary to support the pregnancy.

 

As the uterus contracts after childbirth, the thickened lining of the uterus and blood vessels are broken down and expelled through the vagina as a vaginal discharge called postpartum lochia.

 

The discharge is usually bright red for the first few days and then gradually changes to a brownish or pinkish color, becoming lighter in amount and eventually stopping.

 

Some factors that may increase the risk of heavy postpartum bleeding include:

 

    Prolonged or difficult labour.
    Multiple pregnancies.
    Previous caesarean sections.
    Placenta previa (the placenta implants low in the uterus) or other medical conditions that can affect blood clotting.
     

Symptoms of postpartum lochia

 

The symptoms of postpartum lochia can vary from woman to woman. Some common symptoms include:

 

    Heavy bleeding for the first few days after childbirth.
    Bleeding that becomes lighter in color and amount.
    Clots in the discharge.
    A foul odor from the discharge.
    Cramping or discomfort in the lower abdomen.
     

Preventive measures of postpartum lochia

 

There are several preventive measures that you can take to promote healthy healing and prevent complications related to postpartum lochia. Here are five measures that can help:

 

    Good hygiene practices: Maintaining good hygiene practices is crucial after childbirth, as it can help prevent infections and promote healing. Take showers rather than baths, and use clean towels and sanitary pads to absorb the postpartum lochia.
     

    Adequate rest and recovery: Getting plenty of rest and recovery after childbirth is essential to allow the body to heal correctly. Avoid strenuous physical activities, including heavy lifting, for at least six weeks after delivery. As a mom, you can also aim to get enough sleep and rest when the baby sleeps.
     

    Avoid sexual activity: Avoid sexual activity until the healthcare provider gives you the green light, usually at the six-week postpartum check-up. Engaging in sexual activity too soon after delivery can increase the risk of infection and delay healing.
     

    Follow your doctor's instructions: It is essential to follow the healthcare provider's instructions on how to care for yourself after childbirth. Always attend all postpartum check-ups and follow up on any concerns or unusual symptoms, such as heavy bleeding, persistent pain, or fever.
     

    Healthy diet and hydration: A healthy diet and hydration are important for healing and maintaining good health after childbirth. Eat a well-balanced diet rich in nutrients, including fruits and vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains. As a mom, you can also aim to drink plenty of fluids, such as water and other healthy beverages, to stay hydrated.
     
     

These preventive measures will help promote healthy healing and prevent complications related to postpartum lochia.

 
Conclusion

 

Postpartum lochia is a normal part of the healing process after childbirth. The amount and duration of postpartum lochia can vary from woman to woman, depending on several factors, including the type of delivery, such as vaginal or cesarean section, the number of pregnancies, the health status of the mother and baby, and other individual factors. 

 

It is important to note that postpartum lochia is a normal part of the healing process after childbirth, and it is not a cause for alarm unless there are signs of excessive bleeding or infection. It is essential to follow the instructions provided by your healthcare provider to manage and monitor your postpartum lochia, especially during the first few weeks after delivery, to prevent complications and promote proper healing.
